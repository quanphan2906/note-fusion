# NoteFusion

Notion or Obsidian are great for information storage but sucks when it comes to information synthesis.

If you have a knowledge base of hundreds of documents in these tools, finding patterns between individual notes is time-consuming. You either:

-  Rely on your memory
-  Try out different keywords with their search engines
-  Go through every individual notes (impossible!)

With NoteFusion, you highlight the text block you when to perform semantic search on, press one button, and the app spits out all relevant text blocks across your knowledge base. Neat, right?

Nothing innovative. Just a PoC UX that is conducive to a use case I find common among power users of note-taking tools.
